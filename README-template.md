## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

I learned flexbox in css, anything tags in html how <span> and how to do a responsive design.


```html
<span>You can now listen to millions of songs, audiobooks, and podcasts on any device anywhere you like!</span>
```
```css
.container {
    width: 400px;
    height: 550px;
    background-color: #fff;
    overflow: hidden;
    border-radius: 25px;
    box-shadow: 10px 10px 10px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.4);
    display: flex;
    flex-direction: column;
    align-items: center;
    text-align: center;
}
```

### Continued development

I want to learn more about web applications every day, I am too passionate about programming and I hope to meet the challenges.
